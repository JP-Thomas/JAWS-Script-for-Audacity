New in Jaws scripts for Audacity version 1.1 (8/30/2012):

. Adjust JAWS Options (JAWSKey+v) now contains a section for Audacity options.  It currently contains two options: Announce Messages, which duplicates the CUNTROL+` key, and Announce Toolbars, which controls the announcement of the toolbar name when foacus moves from one toolbar to another.  There is support for the older AdjustJawsVerbosity script, but it has not been tested.
. Thae extension of the Audacity script settings file has changed from .Ini to .jsi to conform to the JAWS scripting convention.  You can rename your existing audacity.Ini file to audacity.jsi and it should work.
. JAWS no longer says "track table" when moving between tracks.
. HandleCustomWindows now calls HandleCustomWindows so that this function in scripts used by this script will be executed.
. Speaks main window areas: Toolbars, Track Panel, and selection Bar, as focus moves between areas.
. Speaks the toolbar name when focus moves from one toolbar to another.
. When focus is in the toolbars pressing CTRL+TAB and Shift+CTRL+TAB moves to the first control on the next toolbar or the last control on the previous toolbar.
. JAWSKey+Delete speaks the current program state: stop, play, play pause, record, or record pause.

New in Jaws scripts for Audacity version 1.1 (8/10/2012):

. added alert message for the following default Audacity hotkeys:
+ Close (Delete) focused track  (Shift + C)
+ Deselect all the tracks (and any time-range)  (Ctrl + Shift + A)
+ Move to start of tracks (time zero)  (Home)
+ Move to end of all audio  (End)
+ Move to start or end of audio in selected tracks ( J or K)
+ Selection start at start of tracks (Shift + Home)
+ Selection end at end of all the audio  Shift + End
+ Selection start or end at playback position ([ or ])
+ Move the end of the selection to the right by a small amount  (Shift + Right Arrow)
+ Move the end of the selection to the left by a small amount  (Ctrl + Shift + Left Arrow)
+ Move the start of the selection to the right by a small amount  (Ctrl + Shift + Right Arrow)
+ Move the start of the selection to the left by a small amount  (Shift + Left Arrow)
+ Delete selected audio (Delete, Ctrl+k, Backspace)
+ Cut, copy selected audio (Ctrl+x, Ctrl+c)
You can toggle these alerts on or off by pressing Ctrl+`
. Jaws now speaks the radio buttons in the warning dialog that appears when importing uncompressed audio files.
. Added scripts for adjusting gain and pan. These scripts replace mouse movement scripts (MouseUp, MouseLeft, etc.), but you can use the original functions by activating theJaws cursor. This feature suggested by Gary Campbell - the original author ofthe script.
. Added hotkey to toggle mute Jaws synthersiser (Insert+shift+s).
Added function autoStartEvent (just a little tip to indicate that the script is active).
Created dictionary file for some mispronounced words.
The Audacity hotkey help (JAWSkey+h) now displays hotkeys as links.
Created installer package (using Nullsoft scriptable install system).
Fixed error in installer (fix by Gary Campbell):
In DisplayJawsList now only counts JAWS version registry keys whose names start with a digit.  This rejects keys like "Common".
