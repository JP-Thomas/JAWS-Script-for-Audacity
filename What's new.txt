. Added hotkey to toggle mude Jaws synthersiser (Insert+shift+s) in some cases.
Added function autoStartEvent (just a little tips to make sure the script active).
Created dictionary file for some mispronounces words.
The Audacity hotkey help (Jaws keys+h) now display hotkey at a link
Created installer package (using Nullsoft scriptable install system).
Fixed error in installer by Gary Campbell:
