You can easily toggle these alert on or off by pressing Ctrl+`
. Jaws now speaks the radio buttons in the warning dialog that appears when importing uncompressed audio files.
. Added scripts for adjusting gain and pan. These scripts replace mouse movement scripts (MouseUp, MouseLeft, etc.), but you can use the original functions by activating theJaws cursor. This feature suggested by Gary Campbell - the original author ofthe script.
. Added hotkey to toggle mute Jaws synthersiser (Insert+shift+s).
Added function autoStartEvent (just a little tip to indicate that the script is active).
Created dictionary file for some mispronounced words.
The Audacity hotkey help (JAWSkey+h) now displays hotkeys as a links.
Created installer package (using Nullsoft scriptable install system).
Fixed error in installer (fix by Gary Campbell):
In DisplayJawsList now only counts JAWS version registry keys whose names start with a digit.  This rejects keys like "Common".
